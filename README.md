# MapLayr

*MapLayr* for iOS is an SDK for displaying interactive venue maps. It is written in Swift and uses Metal for rendering.

# Features

**Camera Controls** — Full support for panning, rotating, zooming and tilting gestures. Programatically control the camera, or have the camera follow the user location marker.

**Annotations** — Show interactive annotations on the map loaded from your data model. Use the built-in annotation appearance, or fully customise your own.

**Routing** — Find routes from A to B, display them on the map or simply utilise them to determine the walking distance. Specify route options to avoid paths with reduced accessibility, and utilise multiple destination points to find routes to the closest entrance.

**Multilevel Maps** — Browse the inside of your building, and see its levels elegantly stacked in 3D.

**Special Effects** — See the sunlight reflect realistically off the bodies of water on your map. Watch it become moonlight when the sun goes down, revealing coloured lights illuminating your map at night.
